# React Hooks
Welcome to the world of tomorrow!

Let's dig into React Hooks. Before we get started you can take a look at the documentation at [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) which is a great overview of the new functionality introduced in React 16.8.

I also fully recommend the [Video Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM&feature=emb_logo) available in those docs.

This module will hit the top-used Hooks available to make replacing our Class Components with Functional components possible, and touch on the use of custom hooks in the future.
